# disaster_response_app

Analysis of disaster data from Figure Eight to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages.  

The data set contains real messages that were sent during disaster events. In this project, a machine learning pipeline is created to categorize these events so that the messages can be sent to an appropriate disaster relief agency.  

This project includes a [web app](https://disaster-response-ml-project.herokuapp.com/) where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. The web app will also display visualizations of the data.
